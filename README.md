# INTRODUCTION

üöÄ I'm actively finishing my MS degree (Sp'24 üéì), while simultaneously pursuing a career in the DevOps field!
+ My focus has included fundamental exercises/tutorials to better understand how IaC (Terraform), CICD methods, Cloud environments, and containerization applications tie together the overall workflow of a devops engineer!
+ Currently studying for the *Terraform Associate (003)* Certificate. 

### üìöCompleted courses and certificates:
1. *Linux Administration* (by Jason Cannon) for a comprehensive understanding of the Linux OS
2. *AWS Technical Essentials* (AWS)
3. *Intensive Cloud Training* (via The Cloud Bootcamp)
4. *DevOps Bootcamp* (by GeeksForGeeks)

# ABOUT ME

üéì I will be graduating SP'24 with my master's degree, of which I have had the opportunity to apply computational methods for analyzing and simulating biophysical models. Starting graduate school as a quest for continuous learning, I've had a positive and incredibly fulfilling experience.

‚òÅÔ∏è  However, my interest in devops grew as I explored 'the cloud.' Despite my initial confusion, delving into this area has been insightful and fascinating, which I expect will continue.

## MISC PROJECT INTERESTS

‚úèÔ∏è  In my free time, you'll likely find me immersed in one of the many Star Wars books or coding a program to simplify planning and mundane tasks. What I love most about the latter is the chance to assist others in enhancing their future decision-making as well!
