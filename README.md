This is a brief rundown of my skills, aspirations, and interests. I hope you enjoy!

	_ Introduction _
Hello!👋 I’m a 3rd year graduate student seeking to delve into cloud and automation!

#🚀 My current endeavors within the DevOps field include studying for the AWS Solutions Architect certificate (February 15), pursuing great project ideas involving Terraform, CICD methods, Cloud environments, and containerization.

#📚 A few courses and/or certificates that I've completed include 'Linux Administration' (course by Jason Cannon) for an architectural overview of the Linux OS, 'Intensive Cloud Training' (via The Cloud Bootcamp), and a 'Devops Bootcamp' (by GeeksForGeeks). Please, visit my LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-williamson-373359107/) for a broader overview of my experience and skills!

	_ About Me _
#🎓 I’m currently finishing my masters degree where I get to use computational methods and apply them to biochemical models. I started graduate school as a means to continue learning, while I figured out what to do. Fortunately, my program experience hasn’t been a bad one. Its actually brought me closer to technology and allowed me to learn hands-on under the supervision of a talented mentor.

#☁️  I started becoming interested in learning more about devops and the tools associated, as I began hearing more and more about ’the cloud’. Everyone’s first impression is probably the same, like ‘how the heck do we use clouds?’ For me, that was enough to spark my interest.

	_ Other Project Interests _
#✏️  Many of the projects that I personally enjoy are programming and automating spreadsheets for planning or prepping future decisions and finances. For me, the best part about practicing these skills is the opportunity to help others hone them as well!
